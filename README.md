# Summary
This is a project to explore what happens when you combine tabular and text data in different ways.

For example:
* Tabular data linearised to text
* Ensemble: average/ weighted average
* Combining vectorised text and tabular representations in and then running a final linear layer

How do these explanations change when I use different explanation methods?

How do these explanations change when I use different models?

When just a textual predictor is used, or just a tabular predictor is used, are the explanations similar to the explanations when both are used?

## Using the textual explanations
I will need to think of a way of linking in my textual explanations. Perhaps feeding it straight in to the textual explainer?

Noura even suggested feeding in the textual explanation as well as the text and tabular input in order to get a better explanation. Even if these experiments are not fruitful, one of the first questions that the examiners will ask is where is the link between the two projects.
